# L-system

The L-system is a program invented by the biologist A. Lindenmayer. It makes it possible to model the growth of plant organisms. The seed already contains within it the final form of the plant.

It is composed of
-an axiom: the shape of the first plant
-growth rules: the different stages of development that the plant needs to reach its final shape

They are both represented by sequences of more or less complex symbols.

Our goal was to create a program in Python to display thanks to the turtle library the different steps of the L-system from the axiom to the final form.
